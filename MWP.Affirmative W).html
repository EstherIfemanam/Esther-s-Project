        <p class="sa">After you have accepting Jesus..You have the gift of the HOLY SPIRIT, RIGHTEOUSNESS..and much more..You don't earn it
            It''s a Gift from God...It's a process of being transformed into the image of GOD!, It's a PROCESS !!..The 
            devil will keep bringing lies of condemnation but we renew our minds with the WORD OF GOD!! ..We refuse to believe the 
            lies of the devil because the word of God says in (Romans 8<sup>1</sup>);
            ''There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh , but after
            THE SPIRIT''
         </p>
         <p class="sa"> WE LIVE BY FAITH AND NOT BY SIGHT!!</p>
         <p class="q">Affirmations and declarations are very powerful.. We renew our minds daily in the understanding of WHO YOU ARE!!</p>

        ,but i have received the 'Spirit of FULL ACCEPTANCE'enfolding me into the family of God, I don't and will never 
        feel orphaned ,because as He rises up within me, my Spirit join Him in saying words of tender affection,'BELOVED FATHER'
        Jesus is continually praying for my triumph...</li>
