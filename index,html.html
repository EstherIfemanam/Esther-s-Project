         2 Timothy 1<sup>9</sup>;<br>
           "Who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according
            to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was 
            given us in Christ Jesus before the world began"
        </p>
     <p class="J">Jeremaiah 31<sup>3</sup>;<br>
     "The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying,Yea, I have loved thee with 
     an <u>Everlasting love:</u>therefore with <u>Loving kindness</u> have I drawn thee "
     </p>
     <p class="so">So many of us have been living in the lies of the devil..it is time to stop living 
         in lies that causes fears and accept the love of God that is unconditional...God 
        loves you so much..nothing can ever separate you from the Love of God. Life starts 
        making sense when you accept the love that God is heartily giving to us..YOU ARE LOVED!!
